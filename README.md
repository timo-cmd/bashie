# bashie
A crazy new project in writing a high-performance scripting language entirely in bash. :P

### Getting started:

Run these commands in an unix like OS:

```bash

cd ./bashie 
cd ./compiler 
mkdir ../output

compile.bat <PathToYourFile.asm>
# may not work now since im still constructing the vm

```

### Options:

#### Debug:

Debug a .asm file with:

```bash

compile -d <PathToYourFile.asm>

```
